                    Stumblin' around, you've been guessin' your direction<br>
                    Next step you can't see at all
                    And I don't have a name, I don't have a name, no<br>
                    Who am I to blame, who am I to blame though?
                    And I cannot be changed, I cannot be changed, no<br>
                    Trust me, I've tried
                    I just end up right at the start of the line
                    Drawin' circles<br>
                    Well I drink my whiskey, you sip your wine
                    Went through a wall, sittin',<br>
                    Watchin' the world falling down its decline
                    And I can keep you safe, I can keep you safe
                    Do not be afraid, do not be afraid<br>
                    You're feelin' sorry, I'm feelin' fine
                    Don't you put any more stress on yourself
                    It's one day at a time<br>
                    It's gettin' pretty late, gettin' pretty late
                    And I find it goes around like the hands that keep countin' the time<br>

                    'Cause I kept you waiting
                    It's a wild, wild world
                    And you're a wild, wild girl
                    Our sun's still shining
                    But it seems half the size
                    And it's a wild, wild world out here
                    Before my time runs out
                    What If I run away to Mars?
                    Would you find me in the stars?
                    Would you miss me in the end
                    If I run out of oxygen?
                    When I run away to Mars
                    I can't tell which way is home
                    I've been gone for so long
                    It's an empty world up here
                    I skip stones and wonder
                    How long 'til I'm discovered
                    It's a quiet life up here
                    Before my time runs out
                    What If I run away to Mars?
                    Would you find me in the stars?
                    Would you miss me in the end
                    If I run out of oxygen?
                    When I run away to Mars
                    Three, two, one, I miss you
                    I'm sorry, I got issues
                    What If I run away to Mars?
                    Would you find me in the stars?
                    Would you miss me in the end
                    If I run out of oxygen?

                    And nobody knows why
                    When we're lost at a club, getting drunk
                    And you give me that smile
                    Going home in the back of a car
                    And your hand touches mine
                    When we're done making love
                    And you look up and give me those eyes
                    'Cause all of the small things that you do
                    Are what remind me why I fell for you
                    And when we're apart, and I'm missing you
                    I close my eyes and all I see is you
                    And the small things you do
                    When you call me at night while you're out
                    Getting high with your friends (high with your friends)
                    Every "hi", every "bye", every "I love you" you've ever said
                    (You've ever said)
                    'Cause all of the small things that you do
